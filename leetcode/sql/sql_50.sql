-- 1661. Average Time of Process per Machine
-- There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.

-- Return the result table in any order.
select a1.machine_id, round(avg(a2.timestamp-a1.timestamp), 3) as processing_time
from Activity a1 
join Activity a2
on a1.machine_id=a2.machine_id and a1.process_id=a2.process_id
and a1.activity_type = 'start' and a2.activity_type='end'
